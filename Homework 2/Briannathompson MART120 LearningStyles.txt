Learning Styles

	Learning Styles are one of the biggest areas contested in education. Many teachers stand by them while others use flipped classrooms or experiential learning. Itâ€™s hard to cater to every student's "learning style," almost impossible actually. I find that giving students breaks, connecting new material to know information and not letting a student move on until they actually understand concepts. Exploring, challenging and breaking down concepts helps students learn faster and retain that information better. Students should also test their own knowledge and be able to determine their overall understanding of what they are learning. If the student doesn't feel they understand something they should go back and relearn it using another modality.  

	Learning styles can also lend to students lack of success. Since learning methods do not actually improve learning, focus on them takes away from the actual learning. If note cards, rewriting notes or rereading materials don't work, then why are we encouraging students to do something that will do nothing for them? Not every learning strategy works for every student, that's where dissecting the information actually comes in. In depth discussions about what we are learning shows more retention, because if we can explain it then we are more likely to remember the information and create better pathways.
